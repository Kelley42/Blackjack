# Blackjack

This was a game I created for a Udemy course. At first I tried using nested dictionaries to store the cards and their values, but it ended up working better simply using a list and converting the cards into values when I needed to sum them. Consequently, I learned a lot about lists and dictionaries in creating this game. I also added exceptions in case the user types incorrect input.
